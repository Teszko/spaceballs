This is more a rough list of possibly-interesting ideas, not a real TODO.

* Size of nodes and length of links depends on the number of links a node has.
  --> constant area per link? --> r=sqrt((links * constant)/(4*pi); physical size 
      ~10 times the visual to creat enough space between nodes
      links between A and B have length of const*(r(A)+r(B)) (physical size)
  --> possibly even a way to enter new formulae for node size?

* Sliders to change physical and visual size of nodes

* click on node to select it. Type c(?) to center world rotation on that node
  - possibly needs different modes 
  - be able to drag nodes around

* List of /search for packages, selecting package colors node
  - remove all links from that node / add back in
  - 
* switch to stop physics-updates - or stop physics updates automatically
